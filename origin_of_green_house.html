   <p><b>Natural Sources:</b><br>
    a. Volcanic Activity: Volcanic eruptions release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and water vapor (H2O) into the atmosphere.<br><br>
    b. Biological Processes: Natural processes like respiration in plants and animals release CO2. Methane (CH4) is produced by natural processes in wetlands, termites, and the digestive systems of animals.<br><br>
    c. Decomposition: The decay of organic matter in forests, wetlands, and oceans releases CO2 and methane.<br><Br>
    
    <b>Human-Induced Sources:</b><br>
    a. Burning Fossil Fuels: The burning of coal, oil, and natural gas for energy production releases significant amounts of CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide (N2O).<br><br>
    b. Deforestation: When forests are cleared for agriculture, urbanization, or other purposes, the stored carbon in trees is released as CO2 when they are cut down or burned.<br><br>
    c. Agricultural Activities: Agriculture, particularly livestock farming, generates methane from the digestive systems of animals and the decay of organic matter in manure.<br><br>
    d. Industrial Processes: Certain industrial processes, such as cement production and the use of synthetic greenhouse gases like hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.<br><Br>
    e. Waste Management: Landfills produce methane as organic waste decomposes anaerobically (without oxygen).<br><Br>
    f. Land Use Changes: Urbanization and changes in land use can alter the balance of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.<br><br>
    
    Greenhouse gases, once released, become part of the Earth's atmospheric composition. They trap heat from the sun, which contributes to the greenhouse effect, leading to an increase in global temperatures. This phenomenon is a major driver of climate change.<br><br>
    
    Efforts to mitigate climate change involve reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to cleaner energy sources, conserving forests, and adopting sustainable agricultural practices, among other measures. It's important to monitor and limit the release of these gases to minimize their impact on the Earth's climate.</p>
