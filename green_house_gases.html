    <p style="font-size: 25px;"><em>
<strong>Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>):</strong> Carbon dioxide is the most prevalent greenhouse gas emitted by human activities. It is released through the burning of fossil fuels (like coal, oil, and natural gas), deforestation, and various industrial processes. High levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are a major contributor to global warming.<br><br>

<strong> (CH<sub>4</sub>):</strong> Methane is another potent greenhouse gas. It is released during the production and transport of coal, oil, and natural gas. It is also emitted by livestock (enteric fermentation in the digestive systems of cattle), wetlands, and the decay of organic waste in landfills. Though there is less methane in the atmosphere compared to CO2, it is much more effective at trapping heat.<br><br>

<strong>Nitrous Oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O):</strong> Nitrous oxide is released from agricultural and industrial activities, as well as the combustion of fossil fuels and biomass. It is also produced by natural processes in soil and water.<br><br>

<strong>Water Vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O):</strong> Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, but its concentration is largely controlled by temperature and natural processes rather than human activities. It acts as a feedback mechanism in the climate system, intensifying the effects of other greenhouse gases.<br><br>

<strong>Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>):</strong> While ozone in the stratosphere (the ozone layer) is beneficial as it absorbs harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation, ground-level ozone is a greenhouse gas and a pollutant. It is formed by chemical reactions between volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides in the presence of sunlight.<br><br>

<strong>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), and Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs):</strong> These synthetic compounds were widely used in refrigeration, air conditioning, and as propellants in aerosol cans. They are potent greenhouse gases, but international agreements like the Montreal Protocol have led to their phasedown to prevent further depletion of the ozone layer and reduce their contribution to global warming.<br><br>

<strong>Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>):</strong> SF6 is used in electrical equipment and as a tracer gas in various applications. It is a very potent greenhouse gas with a high global warming potential.
