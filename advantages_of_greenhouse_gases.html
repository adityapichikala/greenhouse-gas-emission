    <p style="font-size: 25px;">
        <b>Temperature Regulation:</b> Greenhouse gases, including water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and others, help regulate Earth's temperature by trapping heat from the sun. This natural greenhouse effect keeps the planet warm enough to sustain life.<br><br>

<b>Supporting Life:</b> GHGs maintain a habitable temperature range on Earth, making it suitable for various forms of life. Without these gases, the planet would be too cold to support most life forms.<br><br>

<b>Agricultural Productivity:</b> Carbon dioxide is essential for plant photosynthesis. Increased CO2 levels can enhance plant growth, leading to increased agricultural productivity in some cases.<br><br>

<b>Protection from Extreme Cold:</b> GHGs help trap heat in the atmosphere, preventing temperatures from plummeting to extremely cold levels, especially at night. This helps protect ecosystems and human populations from extreme cold events.<br><br>

<b>Preservation of Heat:</b> GHGs slow down the release of heat energy from the Earth's surface into space, maintaining a stable climate over long periods.<br><br>

<b>Water Vapor Feedback:</b> Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas and plays a significant role in regulating temperature. It can amplify the effects of other GHGs through positive feedback mechanisms.<br><br>

<b>Energy from Fossil Fuels:</b> The burning of fossil fuels releases CO2 and other GHGs into the atmosphere, which has been used to generate energy for various human activities.<br><br>
