    <p style="font-size: 25px;">
        <strong>Global Warming:</strong> The primary disadvantage is global warming. Increased levels of greenhouse gases trap more heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to rising global temperatures, which can result in a range of negative impacts such as melting polar ice caps, rising sea levels, and more frequent and severe heatwaves.<br><br>

      <strong>  Climate Change:</strong> Greenhouse gases contribute to climate change, leading to shifts in weather patterns, altered precipitation, and more frequent and severe weather events like hurricanes, droughts, and floods.<br><br>
        
       <strong>Ocean Acidification:</strong> Increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are absorbed by the oceans, causing ocean acidification. This harms marine ecosystems, particularly coral reefs and shellfish, with cascading effects on marine life and fisheries.<br><br>
        
       <strong> Loss of Biodiversity:</strong> Changes in climate and ecosystems due to greenhouse gases can threaten various species, leading to habitat loss and a decrease in biodiversity.<br><br>
        
        <strong>Health Impacts:</strong> Air pollution associated with greenhouse gas emissions, such as particulate matter and ground-level ozone, can have severe health consequences, including respiratory and cardiovascular problems.<br><br>
        
        <b>Agricultural Disruption:</b> Altered weather patterns can disrupt agriculture by affecting crop yields, water availability, and the distribution of pests and diseases, potentially leading to food shortages and increased food prices.<br><br>
        
        <b>Economic Costs:</b> The negative effects of greenhouse gases can result in substantial economic costs, including damage to infrastructure, increased healthcare expenses, and expenses related to adapting to a changing climate.<br><br>
        
        <b>Displacement and Migration:</b> Rising sea levels and extreme weather events can lead to displacement and migration of populations from vulnerable regions, potentially causing conflicts and social disruptions.<br><br>
        
        <b>Ecosystem Disturbance:</b> Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns can disrupt ecosystems, affecting the distribution and behavior of wildlife, including species migration and extinction.<br><br>
